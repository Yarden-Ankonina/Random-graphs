# Erdős–Rényi model - Random graph's
This repo contains an implementation to Erdős–Rényi model to test it out as a class assignment.<br/>
We will use graphs with 1000 nodes and check the graph's characteristics :<br/>
1.connectivity<br/>
2.diameter<br/>
3.isolated vertex <br/>
<br/>

## Main Purpose
- Impelment function to build a random graph with connectivity probability<br/>
- I used an adjacency list to represent the graph<br/>
- Impelment functions for each characteristic <br/>
- Impelment bfs algorithm to find the diameter <br/>
- Run on 500 Graph's with different connectivity chances and look for conclusions.<br/>
