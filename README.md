# Erdős–Rényi model - Random graph's
This repo contains an implementation to Erdős–Rényi model to test it out as a class assignment.<br/>
We will use graphs with 1000 nodes and check the graph's characteristics :<br/>
1.connectivity
2.diameter
3.isolated vertex 
<br/>

## Main Purpose
Impelment function to build a random graph with connectivity probability<br/>
I used an adjacency list to represent the graph<br/>
Impelment functions for each characteristic <br/>
Impelment bfs algorithm to find the diameter <br/>
Run on 500 Graph's with different connectivity chances and look for conclusions.<br/>
